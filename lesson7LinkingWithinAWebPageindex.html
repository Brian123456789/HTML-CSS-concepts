<p>An artisan (from French: artisan, Italian: artigiano) is a skilled craft worker who makes or creates things by hand
 that may be functional or strictly decorative, for example furniture, decorative arts, sculptures, clothing, jewellery,
 food items, household items and tools or even mechanisms such as the handmade clockwork movement of a watchmaker. 
 Artisans practice a craft and may through experience and aptitude reach the expressive levels of an artist.</p>
<h3><a name="paragraph2"></a>Paragraph 2</h3>
<p>The adjective "artisanal" is sometimes used in describing hand-processing in what is usually viewed as an industrial
 process, such as in the phrase artisanal mining. Thus, "artisanal" is sometimes used in marketing and advertising as a 
 buzz word to describe or imply some relation with the crafting of handmade food products, such as bread, beverages or 
 cheese. Many of these have traditionally been handmade, rural or pastoral goods but are also now commonly made on a
 larger scale with automated mechanization in factories and other industrial areas.</p>
 <h3><a name="paragraph3"></a>Paragraph 3</h3>
<p>Artisans were the dominant producers of consumer products prior to the Industrial Revolution.
In ancient Greece, artisans were drawn to agoras and often built workshops nearby.[1]</p>
